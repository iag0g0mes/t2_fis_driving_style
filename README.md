Created by Iago Pachêco Gomes at USP - ICMC, University of São Paulo - Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science

## Introduction

T2FIS Driving Style is an implementation of a Driving Style Recognition using Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System [1]. This repository has the codes to extract the data sequences from Argoverse's trajectory prediction dataset; the codes to calculate the features vectors; the implementation of clustering algorithms (Kmeans, Fuzzy C-means, Gaussian Mixture Models Clusteris, and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering) used to compare the results; and, the implementations of Type-1 and Type-2 Fuzzy Inference Systems.
